# Model Viewer

## Textures and Materials



Unlike other tools, LancerEdit requires texture and material libraries to be open within the editor before being able to display them in the viewport. Missing textures/materials will be made evident through a default magenta material being applied.

Missing references may be found under **Toolsâ†’Resources**

## Viewport Controls

The controls for the viewport will be familiar to those who have used the Unreal Engine 4 Editor. The camera and the model are moved independently using the mouse.
